# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start-api`

Runs the **API server** that handles backend requests.  
The server will run on the configured port (default is `http://localhost:5001`).

This command starts the backend service, allowing the React frontend to communicate with it.

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the **frontend** (React) and **backend API** servers simultaneously in development mode.  
This command requires the `concurrently` package to run multiple processes at once.

```bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```
